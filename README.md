# dotfiles
I manage my dotfiles using `stow`, in the manner described by Brandon Invergo [here](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

I don't use the makeSymlinks.sh script at the moment, I just stow packages as I need them. When I have the time I'd like to flesh the script out a bit more.
