# dotfiles

I manage my dotfiles using `stow` in the manner described by Brandon Invergo [here](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

Some of these dotfiles are directly lifted from or based on [Luke Smith's dotfiles](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice).
